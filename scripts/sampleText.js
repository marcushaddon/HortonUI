So should he lookThat seems to speak things strange.From Fife, great king;Where the Norweyan banners flout the skyAnd fan our people cold. Norway himself,With terrible numbers,Assisted by that most disloyal traitorThe thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,Confronted him with self-comparisons,Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,The victory fell on us.That nowSweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:Nor would we deign him burial of his menTill he disbursed at Saint Colme's inchTen thousand dollars to our general use.No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceiveOur bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,And with his former title greet Macbeth.A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:--'Give me,' quoth I:'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:But in a sieve I'll thither sail,And, like a rat without a tail,I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.I myself have all the other,And the very ports they blow,All the quarters that they knowI' the shipman's card.I will drain him dry as hay:Sleep shall neither night nor dayHang upon his pent-house lid;He shall live a man forbid:Weary se'nnights nine times nineShall he dwindle, peak and pine:Though his bark cannot be lost,Yet it shall be tempest-tost.Look what I have.The weird sisters, hand in hand,Posters of the sea and land,Thus do go about, about:Thrice to thine and thrice to mineAnd thrice again, to make up nine.Peace! the charm's wound up.Enter MACBETH and BANQUOHow far is't call'd to Forres? What are theseSo wither'd and so wild in their attire,That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aughtThat man may question? You seem to understand me,By each at once her chappy finger layingUpon her skinny lips: you should be women,And yet your beards forbid me to interpretThat you are so.Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fearThings that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,Are ye fantastical, or that indeedWhich outwardly ye show? My noble partnerYou greet with present grace and great predictionOf noble having and of royal hope,That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.If you can look into the seeds of time,And say which grain will grow and which will not,Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fearYour favours nor your hate.Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,A prosperous gentleman; and to be kingStands not within the prospect of belief,No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whenceYou owe this strange intelligence? or whyUpon this blasted heath you stop our wayWith such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.Witches vanishThe king hath happily received, Macbeth,The news of thy success; and when he readsThy personal venture in the rebels' fight,His wonders and his praises do contendWhich should be thine or his: silenced with that,In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,Strange images of death. As thick as hailCame post with post; and every one did bearThy praises in his kingdom's great defence,And pour'd them down before him.Who was the thane lives yet;But under heavy judgment bears that lifeWhich he deserves to lose. Whether he was combinedWith those of Norway, or did line the rebelWith hidden help and vantage, or that with bothHe labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,Have overthrown him.That trusted homeMight yet enkindle you unto the crown,Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,The instruments of darkness tell us truths,Win us with honest trifles, to betray'sIn deepest consequence.Cousins, a word, I pray you.[Aside]	Two truths are told,As happy prologues to the swelling actOf the imperial theme.--I thank you, gentlemen.AsideCannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,Why hath it given me earnest of success,Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:If good, why do I yield to that suggestionWhose horrid image doth unfix my hairAnd make my seated heart knock at my ribs,Against the use of nature? Present fearsAre less than horrible imaginings:My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,Shakes so my single state of man that functionIs smother'd in surmise, and nothing isBut what is not.Give me your favour: my dull brain was wroughtWith things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your painsAre register'd where every day I turnThe leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,The interim having weigh'd it, let us speakOur free hearts each to other.My liege,They are not yet come back. But I have spokeWith one that saw him die: who did reportThat very frankly he confess'd his treasons,Implored your highness' pardon and set forthA deep repentance: nothing in his lifeBecame him like the leaving it; he diedAs one that had been studied in his deathTo throw away the dearest thing he owed,As 'twere a careless trifle.There's no artTo find the mind's construction in the face:He was a gentleman on whom I builtAn absolute trust.Enter MACBETH, BANQUO, ROSS, and ANGUSO worthiest cousin!The sin of my ingratitude even nowWas heavy on me: thou art so far beforeThat swiftest wing of recompense is slowTo overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,That the proportion both of thanks and paymentMight have been mine! only I have left to say,More is thy due than more than all can pay.The service and the loyalty I owe,In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' partIs to receive our duties; and our dutiesAre to your throne and state children and servants,Which do but what they should, by doing every thingSafe toward your love and honour.Welcome hither:I have begun to plant thee, and will labourTo make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,That hast no less deserved, nor must be knownNo less to have done so, let me enfold theeAnd hold thee to my heart.

When I burned in desireto question them further, they made themselves air,into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt inthe wonder of it, came missives from the king, whoall-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title,before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referredme to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king thatshalt be!' This have I thought good to deliverthee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thoumightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by beingignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay itto thy heart, and farewell.'Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt beWhat thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;It is too full o' the milk of human kindnessTo catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;Art not without ambition, but withoutThe illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;And that which rather thou dost fear to doThan wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;And chastise with the valour of my tongueAll that impedes thee from the golden round,Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seemTo have thee crown'd withal.Enter a MessengerWhat is your tidings?Thou'rt mad to say it:Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,Would have inform'd for preparation.

Come to my woman's breasts,And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,Wherever in your sightless substancesYou wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,To cry 'Hold, hold!'Enter MACBETHGreat Glamis! worthy Cawdor!Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!Thy letters have transported me beyondThis ignorant present, and I feel nowThe future in the instant.O, neverShall sun that morrow see!Your face, my thane, is as a book where menMay read strange matters. To beguile the time,Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,But be the serpent under't. He that's comingMust be provided for: and you shall putThis night's great business into my dispatch;Which shall to all our nights and days to comeGive solely sovereign sway and masterdom.This guest of summer,The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breathSmells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this birdHath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,The air is delicate.Enter LADY MACBETHSee, see, our honour'd hostess!The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach youHow you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,And thank us for your trouble.All our serviceIn every point twice done and then done doubleWere poor and single business to contendAgainst those honours deep and broad wherewithYour majesty loads our house: for those of old,And the late dignities heap'd up to them,We rest your hermits.Where's the thane of Cawdor?We coursed him at the heels, and had a purposeTo be his purveyor: but he rides well;And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp himTo his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,We are your guest to-night.Your servants everHave theirs, themselves and what is theirs, in compt,To make their audit at your highness' pleasure,Still to return your own. Give me your hand;Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly,And shall continue our graces towards him.By your leave, hostess.If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere wellIt were done quickly: if the assassinationCould trammel up the consequence, and catchWith his surcease success; that but this blowMight be the be-all and the end-all here,But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,We'ld jump the life to come. But in these casesWe still have judgment here; that we but teachBloody instructions, which, being taught, returnTo plague the inventor: this even-handed justiceCommends the ingredients of our poison'd chaliceTo our own lips. He's here in double trust;First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,Who should against his murderer shut the door,Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this DuncanHath borne his faculties so meek, hath beenSo clear in his great office, that his virtuesWill plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, againstThe deep damnation of his taking-off;And pity, like a naked new-born babe,Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsedUpon the sightless couriers of the air,Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spurTo prick the sides of my intent, but onlyVaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itselfAnd falls on the other.Enter LADY MACBETHHow now! what news?We will proceed no further in this business:He hath honour'd me of late; and I have boughtGolden opinions from all sorts of people,Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,Not cast aside so soon.Was the hope drunkWherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?And wakes it now, to look so green and paleAt what it did so freely? From this timeSuch I account thy love. Art thou afeardTo be the same in thine own act and valourAs thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have thatWhich thou esteem'st the ornament of life,And live a coward in thine own esteem,Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'Like the poor cat i' the adage?Prithee, peace:I dare do all that may become a man;Who dares do more is none.What beast was't, then,That made you break this enterprise to me?When you durst do it, then you were a man;And, to be more than what you were, you wouldBe so much more the man. Nor time nor placeDid then adhere, and yet you would make both:They have made themselves, and that their fitness nowDoes unmake you. I have given suck, and knowHow tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:I would, while it was smiling in my face,Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as youHave done to this.We fail!But screw your courage to the sticking-place,And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep--Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journeySoundly invite him--his two chamberlainsWill I with wine and wassail so convinceThat memory, the warder of the brain,Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reasonA limbeck only: when in swinish sleepTheir drenched natures lie as in a death,What cannot you and I perform uponThe unguarded Duncan? what not put uponHis spongy officers, who shall bear the guiltOf our great quell? Bring forth men-children only;For thy undaunted mettle should composeNothing but males. Will it not be received,When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy twoOf his own chamber and used their very daggers,That they have done't?I am settled, and bend upEach corporal agent to this terrible feat.Away, and mock the time with fairest show:False face must hide what the false heart doth know."

He that's coming Must be provided for: and you shall put This night's great business into my dispatch; Which shall to all our nights and days to come Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.  We will speak further.  Only look up clear; To alter favour ever is to fear: Leave all the rest to me.   Hautboys and torches. Enter   DONALBAIN  , MACDUFF  , and Attendants  This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle senses.  This guest of summer, The temple-haunting martlet, does approve, By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze, Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle: Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed, The air is delicate. Enter   See, see, our honour'd hostess! The love that follows us sometime is our trouble, Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains, And thank us for your trouble.  All our service In every point twice done and then done double Were poor and single business to contend Against those honours deep and broad wherewith Your majesty loads our house: for those of old, And the late dignities heap'd up to them, We rest your hermits.  Where's the thane of Cawdor? We coursed him at the heels, and had a purpose To be his purveyor: but he rides well; And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess, We are your guest to-night.  Your servants ever Have theirs, themselves and what is theirs, in compt, To make their audit at your highness' pleasure, Still to return your own.  Give me your hand; Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly, And shall continue our graces towards him. By your leave, hostess.   Hautboys and torches. Enter a Sewer, and divers Servants with dishes and service, and pass over the stage. Then enter   If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well It were done quickly: if the assassination Could trammel up the consequence, and catch With his surcease success; that but this blow Might be the be-all and the end-all here, But here, upon this bank and shoal of time, We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases We still have judgment here; that we but teach Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice To our own lips. He's here in double trust; First, as I am his kinsman and his subject, Strong both against the deed; then, as his host, Who should against his murderer shut the door, Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been So clear in his great office, that his virtues Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against The deep damnation of his taking-off; And pity, like a naked new-born babe, Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed Upon the sightless couriers of the air, Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye, That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur To prick the sides of my intent, but only Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself And falls on the other. Enter  How now! what news?  He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?  Hath he ask'd for me?  Know you not he has?  We will proceed no further in this business: He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought Golden opinions from all sorts of people, Which would be worn now in their newest gloss, Not cast aside so soon.  Was the hope drunk Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since? And wakes it now, to look so green and pale At what it did so freely? From this time Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard To be the same in thine own act and valour As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life, And live a coward in thine own esteem, Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,' Like the poor cat i' the adage?  Prithee, peace: I dare do all that may become a man; Who dares do more is none.  What beast was't, then, That made you break this enterprise to me? When you durst do it, then you were a man; And, to be more than what you were, you would Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place Did then adhere, and yet you would make both: They have made themselves, and that their fitness now Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me: I would, while it was smiling in my face, Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums, And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you Have done to this.  If we should fail?  We fail! But screw your courage to the sticking-place, And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep-- Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey Soundly invite him--his two chamberlains Will I with wine and wassail so convince That memory, the warder of the brain, Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep Their drenched natures lie as in a death, What cannot you and I perform upon The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt Of our great quell?  Bring forth men-children only; For thy undaunted mettle should compose Nothing but males. Will it not be received, When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two Of his own chamber and used their very daggers, That they have done't?  Who dares receive it other, As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar Upon his death?  I am settled, and bend up Each corporal agent to this terrible feat. Away, and mock the time with fairest show: False face must hide what the false heart doth know."
